I chose the colours for this webpage based off of what I thought would look most simple. I didn't use a wide range of colours, 

I chose black for text, blue for links and gray and white as background colours.

I designed the banner to use up a small amount of place but look clean. Because there were a lot of navigation items, it didn't make sense to put them in the banner and I thought that to make the website easy to read, it should be mostly empty.

This website makes use of box-shadow and border radius. I use these two features to make the banner look sharp and the content area easy to read.

I took some inspiration from http://www.polymer-project.org/
Many of the components of the polymer project have a similar feature of a sliding content pane.
