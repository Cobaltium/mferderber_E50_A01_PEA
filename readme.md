This web application is for the PEA of the Computer Science course at Heritage College. The web application makes use of many new web features to display a very simple static web pages. Taking advantage of features such as box-shadow and border-radius to create a sharp looking website. I choose the colours to make the website look as simple as possible. This look of simplicity means as few colours as possible and a very simple to read page. I tried to make it very easy to understand the layout of the page and prevent it from being cluttered by any content that wasn't necessary.
