    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>My name is Matthew Ferderber. I'm a student at Heritage College in my last year of Computer Science. Any further information can be found on my <a href="mferderber_CV.pdf">resume</a>.</p>
    <p>This website is for the Program Exist Assessment (PEA) and contains all of the work I've done towards completing the assessment. To navigate through the website, you can simply use the links on the left side of the page to switch between pages.</p>
    <h3>Teaching Resource Project (TRP)</h3>
    <p>The subject of my PEA is the Teaching Resource Project (TRP) that was worked on in class with a group of students which includes: </p>
    <ul>
    <li>Casey Hynes</li>
    <li>John Drevniok</li>
    <li>Jessica Warren</li>
    <li>Ramiro Sosa</li>
    <li>Liam Henderson</li>
    <li>Michael Abourahal</li>
    <li>Thomas Cummings</li>
    <li>Matthew Ferguson</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each member of the team worked on different portions of the project as developers.</p>
    <p>The purpose of TRP is to allow the academic dean and college administration at Heritage College to assign teaching resources to various courses or activities at the college. The system also includes functionality which allows for better estimation by using previous years to project what the values could be. The project took place over the 5th and 6th semester of the Computer Science program.</p>
