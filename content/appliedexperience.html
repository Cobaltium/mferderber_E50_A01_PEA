    <h3>Co-op Reports</h3>
    <p>Co-op is an important part of the Computer science program because it allows students to gain work experience and see how development teams really work. Working on larger projects gives a much different perspective to how developers work compared to the work done at school. To be eligable for Co-op at Heritage College, students must have a minimum of a 70% average and must pass all of their core courses. For more information about my Co-op experience, my reports from each work term are listed below.

    <h3>Site Visit</h3>
    <p>The site visit to the Algonquin College Security Conference was done in the Fall semester of 2014 and gave us a glimpse into the subject of security. For more information about the site visit, view my <a href="mferderber_E50_A02.docx">report</a>.</p>
